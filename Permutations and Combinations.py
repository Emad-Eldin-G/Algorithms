""" The key difference between permutations and combinations  
is that combinations don't give consideration to order,   
for example, [2,3,4] and [4,3,2] are the same combination
but they aren't the same permutation, as they are in different
order. """

""" In this program we will try to find the perms and combs, given an array of integers.
We will use two methods: using built in itertools, and hard-coding the solution. """
